# Automatic Evaluation of Chronic Otitis Media (COM) Model

This repository contains the machine learning model for automatic evaluation of Chronic Otitis Media (COM) using temporal bone CT scans. The model is designed to assist clinicians and researchers in diagnosing COM and its subtypes, such as chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and cholesteatoma.

## Description

The COM evaluation model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for analyzing three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging data. It provides an end-to-end diagnostic tool capable of processing raw CT images to classify and differentiate various forms of COM.

## Repository Contents

- `model/`: Directory containing the trained model files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with examples and usage instructions.
- `src/`: Source code for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- `data/`: Placeholder directory for users to place their own CT images (actual data not included due to privacy concerns).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for setting up the environment.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.

## Model Features

- Automated feature extraction from CT images
- High accuracy in differentiating COM subtypes
- Pre-trained on a comprehensive dataset of temporal bone CT scans

## Installation

To set up your environment to run the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/COM-evaluation-model.git`

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

`cd COM-evaluation-model`

3. Install the required Python packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the model with your own CT images, place the images in the `data/` directory and run the Jupyter notebook provided in the `notebooks/` directory. Detailed instructions are provided within the notebook.
